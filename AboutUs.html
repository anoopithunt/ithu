  IT  hunt teams are becoming an important part of organizationsâ€™ IT teams, complementing traditional passive monitoring detection efforts with a proactive means to identify, mitigate, and remediate threats. Typically, these teams are composed of a hybrid of various capabilities spanning from counterintelligence to aggressive collection designed to identify the adversary quickly. Since hostile actors enjoy a favorable digital environment in which to conduct their nefarious operations, cyber hunt teams of experienced and well-trained professionals serve as a counterbalance to the agility and adaptability of the bad guys. More importantly, these teams serve as proactive defense assets focused on tipping and queuing transactions and behaviors that drive a more take-charge approach versus primarily relying on known hostile activity. </div>
